# Cryptographic Failures (Secure Example)

This project shows how to prevent cryptographic failures by using secure password storage practices.

---

## üõë Vulnerable Pattern (Previously)

In the previous version (`app.js`):

- Passwords were stored in **plain text**
- There was no hashing or encryption
- It violated secure credential handling principles

---

## ‚úÖ Secure Fix (This version - `safeapp.js`)

- Passwords are **hashed using bcrypt**
- No raw password is ever stored or logged
- Secure comparison prevents timing attacks
